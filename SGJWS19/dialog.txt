INTRO

- Oh no, I lost both of my legs when falling down this ice cave.
- Luckily my arms are made of shotguns.
- Really makes me feel like a video game character with a poorly written backstory. 


BONFIRE

- Brrr, it's awfully cold in here. 
- I should really try to keep warm at these conveniently placed bonfires.


RELOAD MECHANIC

- My shotguns hold 2 shots each and I can reload them once on the ground.
- How do I reload my guns without having any hands?
- That's a very rude question to ask a disabled person...


AMMO

- Look, there seems to be ammunition floating in the air.
- They seem to reload my weapons instantly without having to touch the ground.


SLIPPERY ICE

- That blue ice over there looks pretty slippery.
- It might stop me from reloading my guns properly.
